# LPFSTNet
This is the code and dataset to the paper "LPFSTNet: A Lightweight and Parameter-Free Head Attention-based Student-Teacher Network for Fast 3D Industrial Anomaly Detection" by Yahui Cheng, Junchao Chen, Guojun Wen, Xianhua Tan and Xingyue Liu.

### Code
It will be uploaded soon

### Dataset
This dataset contains 5 different categories of objects (including sleeve, nut1, nut 2, part 1, and part 2) which was collected by ourself via using a D435 depth camera.

The RGB image and depth image of these objects are presented as follow:
![our_data](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/279f1edb-92bd-4b43-a5f7-c204e3a0766d)

These images are designed to consider the environmental background information and uneven lighting conditions to reflect real detection scenarios. 

The training set is composed of only normal samples, where 200 images of each category of objects are collected. 

The test set is composed of normal and abnormal samples, where each category of objects has 30 normal samples and 50 abnormal samples.
